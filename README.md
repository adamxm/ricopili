Ricopili MANC
V1 - May 16, 2016 - Initial release

Installation:
The user should download the ricopili files in rp_bin, then follow the instructions on
https://sites.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/ricopili/home to install ricopili

Download all scripts in the base directory as well, and follow the methods shown in in manc_master_01
to run the pipeline

The method requires some additional files that need to be downloaded (either from here or linked on the web - i.e. eigensoft, snpweights, and PLINK2)

The script is currently set up under the assumption that the user is working on LISA or a TORQUE computing cluster with similar job (e.g. node or memory requirement options in the qsub scripts) input variables to LISA.

The ancestry method detailed here assumes that the user is working on a TORQUE computing cluster. I can provide a version of the scripts that does not require a cluster if there is demand for it.
